      <h2>Lab 11</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is perform localization with the Bayes filter
        on the physical robot. The Bayes filter will make a belief about where
        the robot is based on a full 360 degree spin at each of the locations.
      </p>

      <h3>Localization in Simulation</h3>

      <p>
        The first task of the lab was to run the simulation and ensure the provided
        code all worked properly. This is the corrected code from Lab 10, and the
        procedure is roughly the exact same. A picture of the plot is shown below
        to prove that the code and simulation is working correctly.

      <h3>Implementation on Robot</h3>

      <p>
        While most of the code was provided for us, we were responsible for implementing
        the PID orientation control. This was taken from Lab 9, and the only thing
        I needed to adjust was to have it spin every 20 degrees instead of 10.
        However, my code from Lab 9 collects more than 18 data points, and the provided
        code can only handle 18 points, one from each angle. In order to fix this
        issue, I added a secondary post-processing step that extracts the ToF value
        at each of the desired angles from 0 to 340 degrees. The full code is shown
        below.

      <h3>Lab 11 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        I learned a lot about Bayes filter and its possible implications for my
        robot. I look forward to implementing it in the next lab to help with
        physical localization.

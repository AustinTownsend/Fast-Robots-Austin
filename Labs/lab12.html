      <h3>Localization in Simulation</h3>

      <p>
        The first task of the lab was to run the simulation and ensure the provided
        code all worked properly. This is the corrected code from Lab 10, and the
        procedure is roughly the exact same. A picture of the plot is shown below
        to prove that the code and simulation is working correctly.

      <h3>Implementation on Robot</h3>

      <p>
        While most of the code was provided for us, we were responsible for implementing
        the PID orientation control. This was taken from Lab 9, and the only thing
        I needed to adjust was to have it spin every 20 degrees instead of 10.
        However, my code from Lab 9 collects more than 18 data points, and the provided
        code can only handle 18 points, one from each angle. In order to fix this
        issue, I added a secondary post-processing step that extracts the ToF value
        at each of the desired angles from 0 to 340 degrees. The full code is shown
        below.

      <h3>Tested Points on Map</h3>

      <p>
        The first tested location was (5,-3). This location localized exactly on
        the correct location. The plot is shown below, with the blue dot representing
        the belief of the robot's location.
      </p>

      <p>
          The second tested location was (5,3). This location localized well, but
          not perfectly. It was an extra foot in the positive x direction and down
          a foot in the y direction. The plot is shown below, with the blue dot representing
          the belief of the robot's location, and th green dot representing the
          actual location of the robot.
      </p>

      <p>
          The third tested location was (-3,-2). This location localized exactly on
          the correct location. The plot is shown below, with the blue dot representing
          the belief of the robot's location.
      </p>

      <img src="-3_-2.png" alt="-3_-2" width="700"/>

      <p>
          The final tested location was (0,3). This location localized exactly on
          the correct location. The plot is shown below, with the blue dot representing
          the belief of the robot's location.

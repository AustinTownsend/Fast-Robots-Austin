      <h2>Lab 5</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to design a PID controller for our RC car. Since
        I am part of the 5000 level class, I had the choice to design either a PI
        or PID controller for my robot. The task for this lab is to have our robot
        drive towards a wall and stop exactly 1 foot (304 mm) away from the wall.
        By altering the values for KP, KI, and KD, we can adjust the rise time,
        overshoot, and settling time of our controller.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The first task of the prelab was to ensure Bluetooth was adequate in order
        to start and end the PID controller for the robot as well as collect data
        for debugging and analysis. In order to speed up testing, I also implemented
        cases to define the necessary controller gains (KP, KI, & KD) and the
        target distace (304 mm for the final test). This way, I could redefine them
        via bluetooth and do not need to reflash the Arduino for each small change.
        The Jupyter commands as well as Arduino cases for setting the PID gains
        as well as starting the PID controller with a target distance are shown
        below.
      </p>

      <img src="START PID.png" alt="START PID" width="400" />

      <p>
        During the START_PID case, I store the time, TOF sensor reading, P value,
        I value, D value, and PID value in arrays. Once the test is over, these
        arrays can then be sent to Jupyter via bluetooth using an additional case
        called SEND_PID. This case is shown below. The data can then be parsed
        locally and plotted in Jupyter to help with debugging.
      </p>

      <h3>Position Control</h3>

      <p>
        As mentioned above, the goal of this lab is to have our robot drive as fast
        as possible towards a wall, and then stop when it is exactly 1 foot away
        from the wall. We also want this task to work in a variety of conditions
        such as changing floor material (carpet, tile, hardwood) or starting distance.
        Based on the range of PWM values for motor input and output from the TOF
        sensor, we can calculate a starting range for the proportional controller
        gain. This equation is (max PWM)/(max error), which equates to 255/4000,
        or 0.64. This will be a good starting spot to begin calibrating our P
        controller. The TOF sensor has two modes, short and long. They have different
        sampling rates, different ranges, and different accuracies. Therefore, it
        will be good to test both options to see which performs better durin this
        test. For starting, I will begin with short range mode.
      </p>

      <h3>PID Implementation</h3>

      <p>
        To begin, I started simple by developing just a P controller. Once the P
        controller works, then I will move forward with the PI and PID controller.
        The general equation has three components: proportional, integral, and
        derivative. The equation is shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="PID EQUATION.png" alt="PID EQUATION" width="400" />

      <p>
        The error is found by taking the difference between the current TOF sensor
        reading and the desired distance. Then, this error is multiplied by the KP
        gain to achieve the total P controller output. This value can then be used
        to update the motor speeds for both the right and left motors on the car.
        The goal of testing the P controller is to approach the wall quickly, yet
        avoid too much overshoot so it does not slam into the wall. I found a good
        value to be 0.08. Using this method, I was able to achieve a linear speed
        PWM value of 166. A plot of the TOF reading over time is shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="P CONTROLLER PLOT.png" alt="P CONTROLLER PLOT" width="500" />

      <p>
        The next step is to include the integral component to make a PI controller.
        While we cannot calculate an integral exactly, we will take the same error
        as calculated in the P controller and multiply it by the change in time,
        dt and the gain, KI. Then, we will add this to the previous error, creating
        a sum of errors to find the total "area under the curve". This value will
        then be added to the P term that we calculated up above. However, this
        will lead to integrator wind-up, which could go to +/-infinity and ruin
        our controller. Therefore, I will cap the value at +/-100 to prevent the
        I value from overhwhelming the rest of the terms. I found this value
        experimentally through trial and error. I started my integrator gain value
        around 0.01, and ended uplowering it to 0.005. The goal of the I term is
        to decrease the steady state error, yet the higher it is, it also leads
        to instability with settling time and overshoot. For the PI controller,
        I was able to achieve a max PWM value of 170. The plot of the TOF reading
        over time is shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="PI CONTROLLER PLOT.png" alt="PI CONTROLLER PLOT" width="500" />

      <p>
        The final step is to include the derivative component and complete the PID
        controller. The derivative term is found by taking the difference between
        the current error and previous error and dividing by the change in time,
        dt. Then, we can multiply by our gain value, KD, to calculate the total
        term. Then, we add this to the P and I terms solved above to find the total
        PID value. The purpose of the derivative term is to decrease overshoot, yet
        if you make the value too high, the it increases the settling time too much.
        I started at 5, and ended up decreasing to 2. Also, I adjusted my KP and
        KI values to 0.06 and 0.001 respectively. I was able to achieve a max PWM
        value of 124. The plot of the TOF readings over time is shown below.
      </p>

      <p>
        The full helper function for PID implementation is shown below. Additionally,
        I included the helper functions used to assign the new PWM values to my
        left and right motors. In these functions, I converted the +/-100 scale
        to the PWM +/-255 scale. Additionally, I created a lower limit of 30, which
        is where I found issues with the deadband.

      <h3>Trial Videos</h3>

      <p>
        In order to validate the PID controller, I ran the wall test three times
        to ensure accurate and repeatable data. The three videos are shown below.
        In each trial, the car started about 1100 mm away from the wall (carboard
        box), and it finished exactly 1 foot away from the box (+/- a few mms).
        The three plots of TOF sensor with respect to time are also shown below.

      <h3>Frequency Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        As found during Lab 3, my TOF sensors return data about every 100 ms. While
        it is relatively fast, it is still the limiting factor when it comes to
        our Arduino loop, which runs every 10 ms. When running the PID control
        regardless if the TOF sensor data is ready to be collected, I found that
        the PID control runs about every 8 ms. This is considerably faster than
        the 100 ms from the TOF sensor.
      </p>

      <h3>Linear Extrapolation</h3>

      <p>
        In order to test the spin rates of the two motors, I conducted a straight
        line test using a piece of tape that was 6 feet long. A video of this is
        shown below. Based on the ability of the RC car to make it from one end
        to the other consistently without straying, I am confident that I do not
        need a calibration factor for my motors.

      <h3>Open Loop Test</h3>

      <p>
        This open loop test is a first trial at complete open loop control. After
        assembly the full car, I set down the car and allowed it to complete a small
        trial. In this test, the car moved forward for two seconds, reversed for
        two seconds, and then rotated for one secon and proceeded forward again.
        The video and code for this test are shown below.

      <h3>Additional Task: AnalogWrite Frequency Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        The analogWrite command on the Artemis runs at around 70 Hz. This seems
        a little low, but it is backed up by the time stamps printed to the Serial
        Monitor on the Artemis. The time stamps are shown below. We will most likely
        need to increase this frequency to have better and more accurate control
        over the robot.
      </p>

      <img src="AnalogWrite Freq.png" alt="time stamps" width="100" />

      <h3>Additional Task: Lower Limit PWM in Motion</h3>

      <p>
        As discussed earlier, the lower limit PWM from a standstill for my motors
        is 32. In order to find the lowest PWM value once the car is in motion,
        I first started the car at 32, then incremented down. Experimentally,
        I found this value to be 30.
      </p>

      <h3>Lab 4 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        This was a very fun and informative lab. It was the first time I had done
        a major soldering project. It will also be very important to understand
        how the wiring is all connected in case there are major crashes that cause
        things to go haywire in future labs. Overall, I look forward to being able
        to implement the TOF sensors and new functionality in future labs to accomplish
        more advanced tasks.

      <h2>Lab 5</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to design a PID controller for our RC car. Since
        I am part of the 5000 level class, I had the choice to design either a PI
        or PID controller for my robot. The task for this lab is to have our robot
        drive towards a wall and stop exactly 1 foot (304 mm) away from the wall.
        By altering the values for KP, KI, and KD, we can adjust the rise time,
        overshoot, and settling time of our controller.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The first task of the prelab was to ensure Bluetooth was adequate in order
        to start and end the PID controller for the robot as well as collect data
        for debugging and analysis. In order to speed up testing, I also implemented
        cases to define the necessary controller gains (KP, KI, & KD) and the
        target distace (304 mm for the final test). This way, I could redefine them
        via bluetooth and do not need to reflash the Arduino for each small change.
        The Jupyter commands as well as Arduino cases for setting the PID gains
        as well as starting the PID controller with a target distance are shown
        below.
      </p>

      <p>
        During the START_PID case, I store the time, TOF sensor reading, P value,
        I value, D value, and PID value in arrays. Once the test is over, these
        arrays can then be sent to Jupyter via bluetooth using an additional case
        called SEND_PID. This case is shown below. The data can then be parsed
        locally and plotted in Jupyter to help with debugging.
      </p>

      <h3>Dual Motor Drivers (Power Supply)</h3>

      <p>
        The motor drivers are first connected to the power supply, which can be
        more useful than using batteries. The batteries lose charge relatively
        quick, and the power supply will be able to supply a more consistent input
        voltage. The power supply was set to around 3.7 volts, which is the same
        voltage output as the 850mAh battery that we will use to power our motor
        drivers later in the lab. The setup for this is shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="RIGHT PULSE SETUP.png" alt="Osc right motor" width="500" />

      <p>
        I used basic analogWrite commands to move the right and left motors separately
        for different trials. I tested the right motor first, setting one of its pins
        high at 150, and then its other pin and the two left motor pins low at 0.
        Then, in the loop, quickly switching the high motor pin between 150 and 0,
        showing a pulsing pattern on the oscilloscope. This can be seen in the
        image below where Channel 1, the yellow line, illustrates the voltage
        input based on the PWM signal. The code to run this is also shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="PULSE CODE.png" alt="code to run motor" width="400" />

      <p>
        The next step is to test that both motors work. Below are two videos of
        the wheels working as well as the code used to test the motors. For each
        motor, it goes forward for two seconds, pauses for two seconds, then reverses
        for two seconds.
      </p>

        The first video is the right motor. The second is the left motor.

      <h3>Dual Motor Drivers (Battery Power)</h3>

      <p>
        The following video shows that the RC car can run via battery power. It also
        demonstrates both wheels spinning at the same time.
      </p>

      <h3>Final Component Setup</h3>

      <p>
        The full assembly of the RC car with the various components is shown below.
        The Artemis, motor drivers, and 650mAh battery are all in the main compartment
        below the tape. The two TOF sensors are in the front and on the right hand
        side. Finally, the 850mAh battery is on the underside in the original battery
        compartment. A majority of the wires are stranded wires; however, there are
        a few solid core wires that were used for short connections.
      </p>

      <h3>Lower Limit PWM</h3>

      <p>
        Through experimental testing, I found that the lower limit for PWM for both
        of my motors is 32 when moving forward from a standstill. This was found
        by starting at around 50 and slowly decrementing the PWM value. While turning,
        this value is much higher. For my motors, it was around 120. This was found
        using the same method as for moving forward. For each case, I placed a large
        delay in the code so I had time to place the robot on the floor prior to
        the motors starting. One potential issue is that the battery begins to lose
        power throughout testing. This means that these values could be slightly
        higher than the minimum when using a freshly charged battery.
      </p>

      <h3>Straight Line Test</h3>

      <p>
        In order to test the spin rates of the two motors, I conducted a straight
        line test using a piece of tape that was 6 feet long. A video of this is
        shown below. Based on the ability of the RC car to make it from one end
        to the other consistently without straying, I am confident that I do not
        need a calibration factor for my motors.
      </p>

      <h3>Open Loop Test</h3>

      <p>
        This open loop test is a first trial at complete open loop control. After
        assembly the full car, I set down the car and allowed it to complete a small
        trial. In this test, the car moved forward for two seconds, reversed for
        two seconds, and then rotated for one secon and proceeded forward again.
        The video and code for this test are shown below.
      </p>

      <h3>Additional Task: AnalogWrite Frequency Discussion</h3>

      <p>
        The analogWrite command on the Artemis runs at around 70 Hz. This seems
        a little low, but it is backed up by the time stamps printed to the Serial
        Monitor on the Artemis. The time stamps are shown below. We will most likely
        need to increase this frequency to have better and more accurate control
        over the robot.
      </p>

      <img src="FREQ TIME CODE.png" alt="freq time code" width="300" />
      <img src="AnalogWrite Freq.png" alt="time stamps" width="100" />

      <h3>Additional Task: Lower Limit PWM in Motion</h3>

      <p>
        As discussed earlier, the lower limit PWM from a standstill for my motors
        is 32. In order to find the lowest PWM value once the car is in motion,
        I first started the car at 32, then incremented down. Experimentally,
        I found this value to be 30.
      </p>

      <h3>Lab 4 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        This was a very fun and informative lab. It was the first time I had done
        a major soldering project. It will also be very important to understand
        how the wiring is all connected in case there are major crashes that cause
        things to go haywire in future labs. Overall, I look forward to being able
        to implement the TOF sensors and new functionality in future labs to accomplish
        more advanced tasks.

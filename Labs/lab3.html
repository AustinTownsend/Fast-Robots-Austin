      <h2>Lab 3</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to setup the two Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensors
        and begin to understand the libraries that control them. We learned basic
        soldering to connect our TOF sensors to our artemis and QWIIC Breakout board.
        Additionally, we are aiming to understand the sensitivity of the TOF sensor
        ranges, and we will discuss issues with TOF sensor placement.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The TOF sensors are identical, and thus they have the same I2C address. This
        address is 0x52. However, we will need to find a solution to change one
        the sensor's address because two components cannot communicate with the same
        address without conflicting communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prelab for this lab had us consider a few things regarding planning the
        wiring between each of the components as well as location of each component
        on the RC car. The wiring schematic is shown below. We are using 2 TOF
        sensors to gain information about the car's location and distance from
        potential obstacles. Our first TOF sensor wil face forward so we can detect
        obstacles in front of the vehicle. The second TOF sensor can be placed on
        the front, side, or rear of the vehicle. If the sensor is in the front
        with the first sensor, there will be intereference between the two sensors,
        and we will also need to rotate the car to see obstacles on the sides of
        the car. If we place the sensor on the rear, we will be able to gain
        information when the car is moving in reverse or is flipped over, yet this
        still leaves blind spots on the side of the car. For these reasons, I will
        choose to put the second TOF sensor on the side of the car.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 1: Connecting TOF Sensor to QWICC Breakout </h3>

      <p>
        The wires from the QWIIC connector were cut, stripped, and soldered to the
        corresponding pins on the TOF sensor. Then, the other side of the QWIIC
        connector was connected to the breakout board and connected to the Artemis
        via a smaller QWIIC connector. A picture of the two TOF sensors properly
        hooked up as well as one of them wired with an XSHUT wire is shown below.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 2: Accelerometer</h3>

      <p>
        The next task was to focus on the accelerometer. To start, we implemented
        the equations provided in lecture using atan2 to convert the accelerometer
        data into pitch and roll (in degrees). Pictures of the IMU at various
        positions are shown below. In the pictures, the green line represents the
        pitch and the blue line represents the roll. In order to capture each of
        these graphs, the IMU was help against the side of the table or flat on
        the table to ensure it was held as close to 90 degrees as possible.
      </p>

      <img src="0Roll_0Pitch.png" alt="0R, 0P" width="500" />

      <p>
        Like any sensor, there is bound to be some sort of offset that requires
        calibration to fix. For my IMU, I found that the accelerometer was roughly
        3 degrees off. While this does not seem like a large amount, it can cause
        issues for my car down the road, so I will multiply the values by a correction
        factor to account for this offset.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 3: Fourier Transform</h3>

      <p>
        In order to analyze the amount of noise affecting the accelerometer, we want
        to create a Fourier Transform to convert the data into the frequency spectrum.
        This was done using a simple Fourier Transform off the internet, and a picture
        of the accerometer data in the frequency spectrum is shown below. The
        associated graph in the time domain is also shown for reference.
      </p>

      <img src="ACC_FREQ.png" alt="ACC FREQ" width="500" />
      <img src="ACC_TIME.png" alt="ACC TIME" width="500" />

      <p>
        After analyzing the results, a low pass filter was implemented to help
        reduce the noise at high frequencies. Although there is a built-in filter
        on the IMU already, this is good practice to implement our own LPF. The
        equation for the LPF that was implemented is shown below and is from the
        slides from lecture. The data was then plotted again but this time filtered
        through the LPF. A picture of the plot is shown below as well. While it is
        not the exact same data as above, you can tell that the peaks are smoother,
        and there are less random spikes in the data.
      </p>

      <img src="ACC_LPF.png" alt="filtered acc data" width="500" />

      <h3>Task 3: Gyroscope</h3>

      <p>
        The next task was the analyze the gyroscope functionality. First, just like
        the acceleromater, we needed to convert the data into pitch, roll, and yaw
        (in degrees). Since the gyroscope outputs data in deg/s, we can multiply
        the output by a "dt" value using consecutive timestamps and then add to the
        initial gyroscope reading in order to get current angle in degrees. A
        snippet of my case from the Artemis is shown below to illustrate this math.
      </p>

      <img src="GYR_CASE.png" alt="gyroscope case" width="500" />

      <p>
        When plotting the pitch, roll, and yaw from the gyroscope, I first looked
        at the data when the IMU was sitting flat on the table. The graph of this data
        is shown below. As you can see, there is significant drift in the data points.
        This is due to the "dt" multiplied term. It causes the output to "run" away
        from the resting 0 point.
      </p>

      <img src="GYR_REG.png" alt="regular gyro data" width="500" />

      <p>
        This trend is mimicked when the IMU is moved through space. A plot is shown
        below where I moved the IMU randomly and rotated it in several ways. You
        can see that the drift is especially noticeable in the roll and yaw directions,
        yet it can be seen in all three measurements. This is drastically different
        from the acceleromater data which always returned to the 0 position when
        the ICM was placed back down on a flat surface.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 4: Complementary Filter</h3>

      <p>
        To fix the issue of the gyroscope data drifting away from the 0 position,
        we can implement a complementary filter. This filter combines the data from
        the accelerometer and the gyroscope in order to create more accurate and
        stable angle outputs. The equation for the complementary filter was taken
        from the lecture slides and is shown below. I then tested the IMU flat on
        the table to test the drift as before. The plot of this test is shown below.
        The drift is basically gone, there is just a little noise in the sensor readings
        due to vibration and sensor noise.
      </p>

      <img src="COMP_EQN.png" alt="comp filter eqn" width="700" />
      <img src="GYR_COMP.png" alt="comp gyro plot" width="500" />

      <p>
        The complementary filter was tested again, but this time I moved the IMU
        in random rotations and tangential movements. The drift is almost entirely
        removed for pitch and roll, yet yaw still has some drift. This make sense
        because the accelerometer has no yaw measurement, so the filtered yaw
        value is just the gyroscope reading. A picture of the plot is shown below.
      </p>

      <img src="GYR_COMP_MOVE.png" alt="moving gyro comp" width="500" />

      <h3>Task 5: Sample Data</h3>

      <p>
        In this task, the goal is to speed up our sampling rate so we can collect
        data as quickly as possible. This is done by removing all delay statements,
        print statements, and adjusting the main loop so it no longer waits for the
        IMU to be ready before moving through the loop. Using this method, I was
        able to get a sampling rate of about 3.45 ms. My Artemis code and some of
        the print statements in Jupyter are shown below. Based on the print statements,
        we can see that the Artemis runs faster than the IMU can produce new values.
      </p>

      <img src="IMU_DATA_CASE.png" alt="imu data case" width="400" />
      <img src="IMU_DATA_PRINT.png" alt="imu data print" width="400" />

      <p>
        To show the capacity of how much data could be sent, I recorded for over 5
        seconds. A plot of this data is shown below with a time axis to illustrate
        the data.
      </p>

      <img src="IMU_DATA.png" alt="imu data plot" width="400" />

      <h3>Task 6: Record a Stunt</h3>

      <p>
        The final task of the lab is to play with the RC car and record a stunt.
        Below is a video of the RC car performing some basic functionality such as
        moving forward and backward, turning, and doing a flip. The video ends
        when the RC car ends up on its side. This will prove to be a potential issue
        moving forward as the robot must move autonomously.
      </p>

      <h3>Lab 3 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        This lab was both fun and very informative. The accelerometer and gyroscope
        were both very frustrating to work with in the beginning, yet I was eventually
        able to get the hang of them. They will both be very useful moving forward
        to track the RC car's position and orientation in space. Also, knwoing how
        to implement Fourier Transforms and low pass filters will be useful to analyze
        data in future labs. Finally, it was very nice to be able to play with the
        car and get a feel for what kind of functionality we will be able to implement
        later on in the semester.

      <h2>Lab 3</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to setup the two Time-of-Flight (TOF) sensors
        and begin to understand the libraries that control them. We learned basic
        soldering to connect our TOF sensors to our artemis and QWIIC Breakout board.
        Additionally, we are aiming to understand the sensitivity of the TOF sensor
        ranges, and we will discuss issues with TOF sensor placement.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The TOF sensors are identical, and thus they have the same I2C address. This
        address is 0x52. However, we will need to find a solution to change one
        the sensor's address because two components cannot communicate with the same
        address without conflicting communication.
      </p>

      <p>
        The prelab for this lab had us consider a few things regarding planning the
        wiring between each of the components as well as location of each component
        on the RC car. The wiring schematic is shown below. We are using 2 TOF
        sensors to gain information about the car's location and distance from
        potential obstacles. Our first TOF sensor wil face forward so we can detect
        obstacles in front of the vehicle. The second TOF sensor can be placed on
        the front, side, or rear of the vehicle. If the sensor is in the front
        with the first sensor, there will be intereference between the two sensors,
        and we will also need to rotate the car to see obstacles on the sides of
        the car. If we place the sensor on the rear, we will be able to gain
        information when the car is moving in reverse or is flipped over, yet this
        still leaves blind spots on the side of the car. For these reasons, I will
        choose to put the second TOF sensor on the side of the car.

      <h3>Task 1: Connecting TOF Sensor to QWICC Breakout </h3>

      <p>
        The wires from the QWIIC connector were cut, stripped, and soldered to the
        corresponding pins on the TOF sensor. Then, the other side of the QWIIC
        connector was connected to the breakout board and connected to the Artemis
        via a smaller QWIIC connector. A picture of the two TOF sensors properly
        hooked up as well as one of them wired with an XSHUT wire is shown below.

      <h3>Task 2: Scanning for I2C Device</h3>

      <p>
        As mentioned in the prelab, we expect the I2C address to be 0x52. However.,
        while scanning the I2C channel, it was found that the actual address is 0x29.
        While this might seem incorret, the last bit is used as the read/write bit.
        This means that they share the same bits except for the last bit changing
        between 0 and 1 (change of 23).

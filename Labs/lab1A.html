      <h2>Lab 1A</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to setup the Ardunio IDE and become familiar
        with the Artemis board. We also want to test all the hardware on the
        Artemis such as the temperature sensor and microphone.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The first step was to install all necessary software to support the Artemis.
        Also, it was necessary to acquire all the hardware to connect the Artmeis
        to our personal laptops.
      </p>

      <h3>Example: Blink it Up</h3>

      <p>
        After successfully connecting the Artemis to my laptop, I was able to
        open the "Blink it Up" example. The only necessary change was to alter the
        baud rate to the correct value. The video of the blinking is below.
      </p>

      <h3>Example: Serial</h3>

      <p>
        I was able to get the serial print to work. A video of the serial print
        in action is shown below.
      </p>

      <h3>Example: Analog Read</h3>

      <p>
        This example was meant to test the temperature sensor on the Artemis. As seen
        in the video below, the Artemis is able to get accurate temperature readings,
        and the readings change as my finger is placed on the chip to heat it up.
      </p>

      <h3>Example: Microphone Output</h3>

      <p>
          This example was meant to test the microphone on the Artemis. As seen
          in the video below, the Artemis is able to get accurate frequency readings
          from the ambient noise in the room. As I whistle in the video, you can
          see the frequency change up and down.
      </p>

      allowfullscreen>
      </iframe>

      <h3>Additional Task: Musical "A"</h3>

      <p>
        For this addtional task for the 5000 level class, I wrote additional code
        that would illuminate the LED when the frequency captured by the microphone
        was roughly a musical note "A". This frequency happens to be around 440 Hz,
        so in my code, I accounted for any frequencies from 420 - 460 Hz. In the video,
        I am playing the musical note "A" via a video online in order to accurately
        measure the performance of the Artemis microphone. This task builds off
        of the previous task as well as the "Blink it Up" example.
      </p>

      <h3>Lab 1A Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        While this lab was relatively straight forward, it proved to be a great
        introduction to the Artemis and some basic functionality on the board.
        The scope was both broad yet allowed us to dive deep enough to get a
        comprehensive understanding. I look forward to building off of this first
        lab throughout the remainder of the semester and robot bringup.

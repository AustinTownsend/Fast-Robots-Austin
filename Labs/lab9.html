      <h2>Lab 9</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to map out a static room by collecting ToF
        data at various coordinates within a preset layout in the lab.
      </p>

      <h3>Control</h3>

      <p>
        In order to collect ToF data at each coordinate, the robot needs to do
        on-axis turns in small increments. This is accomplished by repurposing
        the orientation PID controller from Lab 6. In addition to the original
        PID controller case that I wrote for the previous labs, I implemented a
        new case that allows me to redeclare the desired angle for my PID controller.
        Then, I could run a for loop in Jupyter that would send a command every
        0.5 seconds, giving the robot time to settle at each angle then turn to the
        next desired angle. I chose to use a step of 10 degrees in order to capture
        as much data as possible while also ensure the step was large enough for
        the PID to actually move the robot (based on the gain values). The robot
        started at 0 degrees yaw for each trial and took 36 steps until it completed
        a full 360 degree on-axis rotation. The process was repeated for each of
        the four coordinates in the lab map. A photo of the lab map is also shown
        below.

      <h3>Drifting Results</h3>

      <p>
        A successful trial of the car drifting is shown below. The graph alongside
        it shows the orientation (yaw) in degrees as well as the PID with respect
        to time. The PID values correctly align to what I expect to happen during
        the stunt.

      <h3>Lab 9 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        This was the first lab where we were able to utilize the building blocks
        developed in previous labs to conduct a full task. This provided a very
        good practice task of using a mix of linear and orientation motions. I
        look forward to exploring more advanced maneuvers using these techniques.

      <h2>Lab 9</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to have the RC car perform a stunt. I chose to
        do a drift, which involves driving the car as fast as possible towards a
        wall then conducting a 180 degree turn and driving away from the wall.
      </p>

      <h3>Orientation Control (Drifting)</h3>

      <p>
        Drifting consists of three primary components: Driving straight at the wall,
        rotating 180 degrees, and then driving away from the wall. From Lab 7, I
        developed a case to enable the RC car to drive straight towards a wall.
        I repurposed this case to enable flags to allow the RC car to drive straight
        towards and away from the wall for this lab. The second component, turning
        180 degrees, can be solved using the orientation PID control, which was
        developed in Lab 6.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to conduct the full stunt, I had to use flags to turn the orientation
        PID control on and off. I first drove the RC car full speed towards a wall.
        Using the TOF sensor, I could detect when the RC car was within 1600 mm.
        At this point, I turned off the drive case and enabled the orientation PID
        case. This distance threshold allowed the car to turn around and drift
        without hitting the wall. Then, after a set amount of time orienting at
        180 degrees, I disabled the orientation case and re-enabled the drive case.
        The car then drives away from the wall until stopping a second later. The
        case and code in the main while loop are both shown below.

      <h3>Drifting Results</h3>

      <p>
        A successful trial of the car drifting is shown below. The graph alongside
        it shows the orientation (yaw) in degrees as well as the PID with respect
        to time. The PID values correctly align to what I expect to happen during
        the stunt.

      <h3>Lab 9 Takeaways</h3>

      <p>
        This was the first lab where we were able to utilize the building blocks
        developed in previous labs to conduct a full task. This provided a very
        good practice task of using a mix of linear and orientation motions. I
        look forward to exploring more advanced maneuvers using these techniques.

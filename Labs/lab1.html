      <h2>Lab 1</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to setup the Ardunio IDE and become familiar
        with the Artemis board. Additionally, we are focused on establishing BLE
        connection, so we can send and receive messages via Bluetooth. We also want
        to test all the hardware on the Artemis such as the temperature sensor and
        microphone.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The first step was to install all necessary software to support the Artemis.
        Also, it was necessary to acquire all the hardware to connect the Artmeis
        to our personal laptops.
      </p>

      <h3>Blink it Up</h3>

      <p>
        After successfully connecting the Artemis to my laptop, I was able to
        open the "Blink it Up" example. The only necessary change was to alter the
        baud rate to the correct value. The video of the blinking is below.

      <h2>Lab 2</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to establish Bluetooth connection between the
        Artemis and our personal computers. Using Jupyter and Arduino IDE together,
        we will be able to send and receive data using BLE that we will be able
        to build on for future labs.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The prelab consisted of installing all necessary software to establish
        an initial Bluetooth connection. Once Python was installed, the next step
        was to establish a virtual environment that we could run all of our scripts
        through. This helps to keep all the files in a single location as well as
        protect our personal computers if anything were to go wrong. Then, once
        the Jupyter lab was up and running, we could update the Artemis's MAC
        address and create a unique UUID. Finally, once updating the command types
        and config file, we were read to start the introductory tasks in the lab.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 1: ECHO</h3>

      <p>
        The first task was to create an ECHO command that would send a string
        from our computer to the Artemis board, and in response, the Artemis would
        send back a string to the computer. Below is the ECHO case that was written
        on the Artemis board.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to send and receive the string, the following code was written
        in the Jupyter notebook. In this example, the sent message was "HiHello",
        and the reply from the robot was "Robot says --> HiHello :)".
      </p>

      <h3>Task 2: GET_TIME_MILLIS</h3>

      <p>
        The second task was to create a command that would make the Artemis reply
        with a string that was the current time in milliseconds. This utilizes a
        built in function millis() that tracks the amount of time since the Artemis
        was powered on. Below is the GET_TIME_MILLIS case that was written on the
        Artemis board.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to send and receive the string, the following code was written
        in the Jupyter notebook.
      </p>

      <h3>Task 3: Notification Handler</h3>

      <p>
        The next task was to write a notification handler that would help extract
        the time from the Artemis board. The purpose of a notification handler
        is to constantly be listening to the Artemis and send the desired information
        when the command is called. The image below shows the basic notification
        handler that I wrote to extract the time, in seconds, since the Artemis
        was powered on.

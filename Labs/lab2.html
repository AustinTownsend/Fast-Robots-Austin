      <h2>Lab 2</h2>

      <p>
        The purpose of this lab is to establish Bluetooth connection between the
        Artemis and our personal computers. Using Jupyter and Arduino IDE together,
        we will be able to send and receive data using BLE that we will be able
        to build on for future labs.
      </p>

      <h3>Prelab</h3>

      <p>
        The prelab consisted of installing all necessary software to establish
        an initial Bluetooth connection. Once Python was installed, the next step
        was to establish a virtual environment that we could run all of our scripts
        through. This helps to keep all the files in a single location as well as
        protect our personal computers if anything were to go wrong. Then, once
        the Jupyter lab was up and running, we could update the Artemis's MAC
        address and create a unique UUID. Finally, once updating the command types
        and config file, we were read to start the introductory tasks in the lab.

      <h3>Task 1: ECHO</h3>

      <p>
        The first task was to create an ECHO command that would send a string
        from our computer to the Artemis board, and in response, the Artemis would
        send back a string to the computer. Below is the ECHO case that was written
        on the Artemis board.

        In order to send and receive the string, the following code was written.
